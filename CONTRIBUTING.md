# Welcome  :smile:

If you wish to join me in making this script better, have a read at it, it's quite small for now, and see if you have any ideas, go for it and we'll see from there.

I'm quite bad at docstrings, so that's always something I could use help with.

Have you seen a typo?

Do you have an ideea how to make the code more readable, I'm open to suggestion!

New features and functionality? All ears (and eyes if I see a pull request)

Any contribution would be awesome, even if it's just an advice!!!

## Thank You :hugs:
