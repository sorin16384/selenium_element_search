# selenium_element_search

Just to mention, I'm a beginner to all this, so it it's very possible to make some mistakes

The idea is to create a Python script that contains various functions,  that with the help of the Selenium library, searches for web elements, raising no errors,  and in the same time writes automatically into a log file what is being searched and if the element was found.

For those who want to contribute, if you take a look at the element_search.py script you will see the writing style and what's the whole idea.
All functions will use the same template as the test_for_xpath() function.

## Important note:
    * you should already have selenium installed
    * along with the specific driver for your platform and web browser

Refer to  [https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)  for help with that

Will update with examples of usage and explanations.
