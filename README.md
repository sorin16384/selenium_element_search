# selenium_element_search

I'm a beginner to all this, I have an idea, give me a few days to solidify some of it.

The ideea is to create a Python script that contains functions,  that with the help of selenium library, searches for web elements, raising no errors,  and in the same time writes automatically into a log file what is being searched and if the element was found.
Will start with the logging function.
