# selenium_element_search

Just to mention, I'm a beginner to all this, so it it's very possible to make some mistakes

The idea is to create a Python script that contains functions,  that with the help of Selenium library, searches for web elements, raising no errors,  and in the same time writes automatically into a log file what is being searched and if the element was found.

If you take a look at the element_search.py script . you will see the writing style and what's the whole idea.

Will update with examples and explanations.
